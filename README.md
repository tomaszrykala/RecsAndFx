RecsAndFx
==========

App demonstrating various DSP Audio Effects, by applying them to source audio, eg. a connected microphone and storing the recordings on the device for further playback.

Usage
---------------

The app consists of the List of all Effects available.

Upon selection the **Effect** may offer various controls for modulating its characteristics.
The **Record** button arms the device into recording mode, in which it captures the sound coming from the default source - eg. microphone and applies the Effect.
When using the device's built-in microphone, it's important to enable '**Pass-through**' by clicking the Icon in the AppBar, while ensuring that the output volume is as low as possible without introducing harsh feedback.

Implementation
--------------

The app is also a sandbox of latest Android development practices and it incorporates:
- UI, State Management and Navigation using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) and related libraries
- Dependency Injection using [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/)
- [App Modularisation](https://developer.android.com/topic/modularization) by feature
- ??... (TODO)

Acknowledgments
---------------

The implementation borrows heavily from the following open-source projects:
- [Google Oboe](https://github.com/google/oboe) - for the C++ implementations of DSP Audio Effects
- [oboe_fx_recorder](https://github.com/HeroSony/oboe_fx_recorder) - for the app idea and documentation
- [Oboe Recorder](https://github.com/sheraz-nadeem/oboe_recorder_sample) - for the recording capability

Pre-build
---------
Link Oboe path directory in CmakeLists.txt
```
set (OBOE_DIR <path_to_oboe>)
```

Add [libsndfile](https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile) library
```
set(LIB_SND_FILE_DIR <path_to_libsndfile>)
add_subdirectory(${LIB_SND_FILE_DIR} ./sndfile)
include_directories(${LIB_SND_FILE_DIR}/src)
```

Build and deploy.
